Featuring recommended [music] for each poem and a description of my thoughts on each poem.

This is version `0.1-tq` of this book.

Due to finishing a Master's, learning Japanese, trying to work out consistently, and many other life events, I want to release 2 versions of this book: This one, a minimal version with enough content to be fun and interesting, and v2.0, which should include a scrapbook-style background for each tanka with [art] from many artists.
