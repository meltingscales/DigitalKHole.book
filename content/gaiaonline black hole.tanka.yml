tankadesc: "This tanka was written to capture the feeling of a loss of a childhood spent almost entirely in online spaces. The realization that Poptropica, AdventureQuest, Roblox, GMod Lobbies, RuneScape....those online spaces are either totally dead, or not fun to engage with anymore as adults. The magical feeling of rushing home after high-school/gradeschool to log on and play with your friends - gets harder and harder to capture as you get older. And, if you do choose to engage with those online spaces, you might feel a sense of loss, a grief of a childhood joy that's either died, or that you're incapable of experiencing anymore."
tastingnotes: "This tanka is paired with a short, slow, spaced-out song that is broken and somewhat chaotic. It starts immediately like a broken robot, or a dying insect. The first third of the song is a mix of chopped vocalizations, crackling synth textures, and noise. The entire song fluctuates in pitch and tone, some parts are harsher, and some are softer. But, the entire song sounds like the dying breaths of a sad entity that's lamenting its shortening existence. \n\nThe rest of the album is very different from this song, and much more upbeat, but I chose this song specifically because it sounds like something that's dying."
