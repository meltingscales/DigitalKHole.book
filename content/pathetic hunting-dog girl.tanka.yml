  This tanka was written about being sexually attracted to scary, industrial-grade bio-mechanical monsters. This is a direct reference to an erotic piece of fiction called "PROMISING NEW BLOOD" by Jodie Carrion sub-titled "174 pages of ex-military special agent x her pathetic hunting dog-girl smut." The piece of erotic fiction is about surviving a fascist regime that weaponizes trans-ness through political and corporate means. It's about how trans people are forced to live in a society that both fetishizes and demonizes them at the same time. The scenes with "Daisy", when a human-animal abomination, stripped of free will, has sex with Ciara, are what inspired this.

  This tanka is paired with a song that immediately opens with raw, coarse vocals describing mortal panic, death, freezing up, and sexual dysfunction. A tinny, fast bassline adds to the vocals. The bassline opens to a faster one, new lyrics describing confusion and a parasitic sexual experience - "I die in wet dreams, I hate your love". These vocals open up to a swinging bassline and that devolves into a pounding, exhausing faster bassline with vocals - "We fuck like we're being held hostage, I'm fucking exhausted, the neighbors are watching". We get a short break ["killing me"], and back to the main hook, tirelessly, back to the faster hook, and back to the intro, "I'm a deer in the headlights, I'm a deer in the sheets, I'm a deer and the headlights, I'm a rotting corpse in the street".
