  This tanka was written about online friends, Garrett O and Gunner, that I've totally lost contact with. They were
  two Kentucky(?)/Texas(?) teenagers that I played Minecraft with almost DAILY when I was a teenager. We had
  so many goofy ass adventures together - mining, building bases, punting eachother into lava pits and screaming
  ...oh so much screaming. I couldn't wait to play with these - i say this lovingly - crackheads - when I got home
  from gradeschool/highschool. And...I just logged into Skype, and checked my messages from 2014. They're all
  gone, and I don't know if I'll ever see these 2 goofy, lovable idiots again. I hope I can find them again.
