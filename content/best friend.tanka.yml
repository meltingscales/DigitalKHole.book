tankadesc: "This tanka was written to capture what dogs are like and what they mean to me. They're fun, energetic, they love running and sniffing and greeting people, they're very loving and loyal, and smell weird, and they're literally the closest thing to God embodied in a creature. They can almost never do wrong and I love them so much."
tastingnotes: 'This tanka is paired with an extremely fun, bouncy, high-energy song that samples dog barks heavily. The song starts with dog barks pitch-shifted, and immediately starts sampling "my humps" by the black eyed peas. At 10 seconds, the song the song builds into a peak, and drops into a bouncy, euphoric bassline (all while sampling dog barks, still). The rave piano stabs and dog barks add to the euphoric/fun vibe of this song. The midpoint of the song melts into a sample of "run-around" by blues traveler, giving the listener a short break from the unrelenting, bouncy bassline, before it intrudes again (with MORE DOG BARKS!!!!) and another drop builds in the 2/3rds mark - and "my humps" is reintroduced with a massive layering of all previous elements. A very "heavy" and fun song.'
