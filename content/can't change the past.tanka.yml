  This tanka was written about how past trauma "sticks" to you and can condition you to act a certain way. It's
  about feeling like you want to barf in the grocery store, wanting to sprint away from a crowded bus, about being
  antisocial and having evil phantoms that live inside you that are hard to vomit out. The feeling of being a deformed,
  wriggling pile of flesh, bones, fur, spines, ribcages, eyeballs, trying to sit still on the bus, feeling terrified
  of both yourself and every other person. Curling into a ball. Wanting to disappear. Hating yourself. Mentally
  preparing yourself for every social interaction, dreading when you have to look at someone or be looked at.

  This tanka is paired with an uncomfortable, slimy, heavy, congested song that begins with backwards vocals and a
  sharp "HOW-IS-IT?" question that's repeated over and over. A tortured, mutilated social gesture painfully extracted
  like a rotten tooth from the singer's throat. Steel wool of a bassline scratching the song. It repeats: "HOW...
  IS... IT?" 2/5ths, a pause. "How's it going to-day?" over and over. HOW?! "How's it going to-day? HOOOOW?"
  1/2 done. The repetition stops. "Looked at me...in a funny way. They don't know...that I'm here to stay. They like
  me more...when I have nothing to say (...) Give it everything I've got." Survival in a social nuclear wasteland.
