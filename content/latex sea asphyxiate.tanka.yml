tankadesc: "This tanka was written to capture the feeling of realization that comes with spending nearly decades of your life pursuing fake news, fake fantasies, videogames, arguments on 4chan (/pol/, /lgbt/, /b/), arguments about fake things with other people who also spend too much time online, playing videogames that demand too much of your time and de-socialize you, perhaps nurturing a malignant porn addiction, etc. The feeling of realizing you're a stray dog trained to respond to digital stimulus, and your fur is patchy and caked with filth, you're wounded and your ribs are visible, you haven't seen the grass in years, yet your body desperately craves more online interaction, more stimulus, and you don't know how to stop. A new digital escape replaces the previous digital escape."
tastingnotes: 'This tanka is paired with a song that has a very harsh transition, and exquisite textures. The song starts out quiet, and reserved, with slow pong-like water drips of synths echoing in a dark, windy void. The song opens to a slow, buzzing bassline with electric synths to pair with the pond-drips of softer synths. At 1/3rd, it opens into a chittering, screeching midpoint that continues, and slowly stops (...) The floor drops from under you, and a massive, impenetrable black wall of sound destroys your body. Vocalization echo as if an aftershock from an atomic bomb dropping. After 3-4 of these blasts, the assault becomes constant, and the bassline morphs into a howling, continuous, twisting wave cascade. Then, the song slowly ends. Recommended "she spoke of it" after listening.'
