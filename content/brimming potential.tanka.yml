tankadesc: "This tanka was written about software programming. If you get good enough at it, you can manipulate data like LeBron James dribbles a basketball. It's extremely fun and profitable. All websites, phone apps, videogames, computer peripherals, displays, monitors, electrical devices, etc - they all make sense. Especially with data processing - JSON, CSV, XLSX, PDF, DOCX - They're all reducible down to fundamental principles of programming. With how fast AI like ChatGPT is able to help template software programming, new software is going to be written MUCH faster. Data is code and code is data. Humans are becoming godlike in their ability to create."

  This tanka is paired with a chirpy, fast-paced and "airy" song that opens with a punchy sour-sounding chittering beat with a backdrop of an acid synth. A lot of small patterns get repeated across the song, with layering of medium and large patterns. I compare this to how software programming - source code - has lots of mini, small, medium, and macro patterns. There is beauty in the swirls and ridges of the code. The midpoint of the song leads into a fun, dripping/chiming section, with some squishy synths and corruption, and a long, drawn-out backdrop. The chittering drops off (3/5ths) and resumes with some bumpy/metal synths, and slowly devolves into different instruments, claps, metal clangs. The 9/10ths mark has almost all instruments drop off save for tiny bumps.
