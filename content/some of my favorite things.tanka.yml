  This tanka was written about the AWESOME parts of childhood. The best parts of my childhood. Going to the beach, playing modded minecraft with intricate AE2 auto-craftingnetworks, running around with my 2 lanky, goofy, sensitive greyhound dogs, getting home from highschool/gradeschool and seeing my parents. I miss all of that. I miss my parents and my dogs dearly....I can adopt new dogs, build enterprise-grade minecraft modpack servers with AE2 mods, and I can pretend I'm a kid again, but I can never actually have those magic moments again. But... I can be a parent to someone else, and give that to them. Also...Minecraft is why I got into CyberSec!!!

  This tanka is paired with a slow, peaceful, feather-gentle song by C418. This is a Minecraft song. It opens with an airy, reverberating piano that sounds like it's made of yellow cloud-feathers or glass. At 1/3, piano drops off, shimmering, glassy, and comes back on, softer. The midpoint is a piano contemplation, a soft glass-tree to lay your head in and stare at the blue-white sky. The piano peeks its head back in and checks on you at 3/4ths. It comes back to life and says hello. I remember my dad showing me minecraft for the first time - I was so scared of the creeper mobs, especially at night. We had so much fun. The song ends with a soft piano and a few notes of a deep cello.
