  This tanka was written about 4lung. She's an internet musician who has been demonized
  and hated on by many people. I remember back in college, when I was undersocialized, alone, anxious,
  and afraid of many things, my dad had passed away recently and I was recovering from sexual abuse, I discovered
  4lung's music and realized I loved it.
  I shared it with my only gay friend at the time, "M", who immediately jumped on me and called me a monster for
  listening to her music. He said she was evil, she hurts people, etc; I know he was wrong but I was so terrified
  of being "cancelled" by my only gay friend I had ever had, and I decided to shut up and pretend I didn't
  listen to 4lung, even though I still love her music to this day. I've since shed "M" as a friend, but it's made me
  distrustful of queer people in general.

  This tanka is paired with a song that gently, tired-ly, starts with a soft, tired guitar and horn intro; relaxed drums.
  "I might not be here forever, at least not in this form.", and moving on, "i'll turn to what's in front of me  and never look back".
  A reflection on the hedgehog's dilemma - We want to love, but also demonize them. 1/2 done.
  A stark refusal to give up, refusing to compromise, and refusing to change what you are, to spit in the face of those that hate you.
  Faster, more upbeat horns and drums. A happier part of the song to defy those who hate you and want to "pour their hate into you". "Who am I to blame you for wanting to take everything from me?"
