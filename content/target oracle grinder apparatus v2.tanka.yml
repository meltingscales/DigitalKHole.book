tankadesc: "This tanka was written to capture the feeling of grinding hard on a gaming session, a late-night project, a twitter DM thread, or any other digital media. The feeling of being glued to a monitor and keyboard for 8+ hours, at 2AM, ingesting stimulants, and the physical and mental sensations that go with that. I have vivid memories of my factory-building while having razor-sharp focus, and really enjoying the physical and mental feedback loops from that isolation. It's really not good for you, but it feels good and you can get a LOT accomplished."
tastingnotes: "This tanka is paired with a short, dense song that starts off with a steep ramp into a chaotic mess of drums and and sharp metallic synths. It opens into a packed, punchy first quarter with only seconds of pause between the drowing cascade of drums, samples, and synths. The first quarter moves into the middle with some vocals, and a buildup that goes into a very packed, layered descent into the meat of the song. It's extremely fun and chaotic to listen to this song, and I really think it captures the feeling of being overstimulated or hyperfocused. After the buildup and midpoint, the song unlayers itself and returns back to the drums and metallic synths."
