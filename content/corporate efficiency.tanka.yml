  This tanka was written about modern cyber/software jobs and burnout. I've found that, in new cybersec/programming roles, management will assign *as much work as someone will consume*. Not as much as is reasonable or comfortable, but possibly enough to drown them. This means for people-pleasers, ADHD/autism havers, you WILL drown yourself. You frequently delve into harder and more complicated work, say yes to more work, and have to continually slice your calendar time thinner and thinner, multitask more, close the efficiency loop in minutes, half-minutes, 10-sec, and single seconds. Alt-tabbing, automated scripts, keyboard macros - The optimization never stops, until burnout and crash occurs.

  This tanka is paired with a bouncy, fast, and hard song. A rolling bassline quickly fades in, with vocals swinging
  forward. A single pulse, sparkles, and the anticipation...crashes forwards. It drops! A hard rubber ball, a giant
  factory, a giant anvil, endlessly pounding dense metal. Deathless march forward. A shift, and more hammering.
  Squeaky instrumentals and drums, a metal horse galoping at 120MPH, screaming metal and runner. 1/2 point.
  A beautiful, sunlit lake off to the side. A short reflection on the dozens of miles and hundreds of acres of
  constructed metal factories and starlight. Fun vocalizations whooping. A drop building again. Back to work!
  Hundreds, thousands, millions of tasks complete. Building God...slowing down. And...it grinds to a halt.
