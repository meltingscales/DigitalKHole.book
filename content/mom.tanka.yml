  This tanka was written about my mom, an Arabian-born, Australian-by-blood juggernaut of a woman. She
  raised me with my dad, and while they weren't perfect, I loved them both deeply. I have fond memories of my
  greyhounds, sharing meals with them, watching cartoons, going to feed ducks at the park, being pushed around
  in a stroller, running around in leaves, eating naan, playing with my animals.

  I don't feel like explaining this tanka more. Enjoy :)
